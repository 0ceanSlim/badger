# Badger App

Badger is a [nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol) client for creating [kind 8 nostr badges](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/58.md)

I have an example of this client running at <https://badger.happytavern.co>

If you would like to host your own instance all you need is go installed on your system

## Running

- Copy the example config `cp config.example.json config.json` (this just defines the port to run on)

- Then just run `go run ./` from the root directory.
